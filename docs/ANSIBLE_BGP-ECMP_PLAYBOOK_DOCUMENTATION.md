# Ansible BGP-ECMP Playbook Documentation

There are 6 playbooks used to configure the network environment's settings.
There are 4 variable files where values are defined that are used in those playbooks.  If any changes are desired to the
settings applied to the network, they should be made in the variable files.

## Common to all playbooks in this set:

### Playbook-level fields:

__hosts:__ bigip
  This field refers to the hosts file which groups all the bigip devices under this alias.  This means that when this playbook is run, it will be executed for each Bip-IP device defined under the alias [bigip].

__connection:__ local
This field specifies that the process will be running on (or delegated to) the machine where this playbook is executed.


### Task-level fields:

__validate_certs:__ "{{ validate_certs }}"
This is set to `no` or `false` by default.

__user:__ "{{ username }}"
This field takes in the username.
This is an Ansible vault-encrypted string.

__password:__ "{{ password }}"
This field takes in the password.
This is an Ansible vault-encrypted string.

__server:__ "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
The name of the host. By default this is set to `ansible_host`
`ansible_host` is variably defined inside the host_var files as device-specific IP addresses.

### <a name="vlan"></a>VLAN_PLAYBOOK

There are two Ansible Plays in this playbook.  One configures the internal VLAN of each Big-IP
device that it's invoked upon.  The other configures the external VLAN for each device.  The
functionality and fields specified in the Plays are identical.  The differentiation lies in the
reference to variables in the host_vars file for each Big-IP device.  Several fields are common
between both Plays and reference the group_vars file.
```
# vlan playbook
---
- name: vlan_playbook
hosts: bigip
connection: local
tasks:
- name: Create Internal VLAN on the BIG-IP
  bigip_vlan:
    name: "{{ vlanIntName }}"
    server: "{{ ansible_host }}"
    tag: "{{ tagInt }}"
    untagged_interfaces: "{{ interface12 }}"
    user: "{{ user }}"
    password: "{{ password }}"
    validate_certs: "{{ validate_certs }}"

- name: Create External VLAN on the BIG-IP
  bigip_vlan:
    name: "{{ vlanExtName }}"
    server: "{{ ansible_host }}"
    tag: "{{ tagExt }}"
    untagged_interfaces: "{{ interface11 }}"
    user: "{{ user }}"
    password: "{{ password }}"
    validate_certs: "{{ validate_certs }}"
    ```

#### VLAN Playbook fields

__[bigip_vlan](https://f5-ansible.readthedocs.io/en/devel/modules/bigip_vlan_module.html):__
This is the name of a predefined __module__ in Ansible, built by F5.

__name:__ "{{ vlanIntName }}"
This field is the label given to the Internal VLAN.  This value is used elsewhere in other Ansible
playbooks to reference these VLANs.

__tag:__ "{{ tagInt }}"
__tag:__ "{{ tagExt }}"
These fields take in the tag value for the internal and external VLANs, respectively.

__untagged_interfaces:__ "{{ interface11 }}"
__untagged_interfaces:__ "{{ interface12 }}"
These fields take in untagged interface values.  Interface 1.1 for the internal, 1.2 for external.


## <a name="self"></a>SELFIP_PLAYBOOK

There are two Ansible Plays in this playbook.  One configures the internal Self-IP of each Big-IP
device that it's invoked upon.  The other configures the external Self-IP for each device.  The
functionality and fields specified in the Plays are identical.  The differentiation lies in the
reference to variables in the host_vars file for each Big-IP device.  Several fields are common
between both Plays and reference the group_vars file.
```
# selfip playbook
---
- name: selfip_playbook
  hosts: bigip
  connection: local
  tasks:
  - name: Create Internal SELF-IPs on the BIG-IP
    bigip_selfip:
      name: "{{ selfAddrInt }}"
      address: "{{ selfAddrInt }}"
      netmask: "{{ netmask }}"
      server: "{{ ansible_host }}"
      user: "{{ user }}"
      password: "{{ password }}"
      validate_certs: "{{ validate_certs }}"
      vlan: "{{ vlanIntName }}"

  - name: Create External SELF-IPs on the BIG-IP
    bigip_selfip:
      # 'name' can just be the IP
      name: "{{ selfAddrExt }}"
      address: "{{ selfAddrExt }}"
      netmask: "{{ netmask }}"
      server: "{{ ansible_host }}"
      user: "{{ user }}"
      password: "{{ password }}"
      validate_certs: "{{ validate_certs }}"
      vlan: "{{ vlanExtName }}"
```
#### Self-IP Playbook fields

__[bigip_selfip](https://f5-ansible.readthedocs.io/en/devel/modules/bigip_selfip_module.html):__
This is the name of a predefined module in Ansible, built by F5.

__name:__ "{{ selfAddrInt }}"
__name:__ "{{ selfAddrExt }}"
*Host specific variable*. This field is the address assigned to the Internal or External self-ip, respectively.

__netmask:__ "{{ netmask }}"
This field specifies a particular netmask.  By default its set to `255.255.255.0`

__vlan:__ "{{ vlanIntName }}"
__vlan:__ "{{ vlanExtName }}"
These fields take in a name label for the internal and external vlan's, respectively. These are the
same names specified in teh VLAN_PLAYBOOK and we're using them to directly call those VLANs for
linkage with the Self-IPs.

## <a name="route"></a>ROUTEDOMAIN_PLAYBOOK

There is one Ansible Play in this playbook.  It configures the route domain of each Big-IP
device that it's invoked upon.  Several fields are common between both Plays and reference the
group_vars file.
```
# routedomain playbook
---
- name: Route Domain Playbook
  hosts: bigip

    bigip_routedomain:
      id: "{{ id }}"
      user: "{{ user }}"
      password: "{{ password }}"
      server: "{{ ansible_host }}"
      validate_certs: "{{ validate_certs }}"
      routing_protocol: "{{ rProtocols }}"

## <a name="vserver"></a>VSERVER_PLAYBOOK

There is one Ansible Play in this playbook.  It configures the virtual server of each Big-IP
device that it's invoked upon.  Several fields are common between both Plays and reference the
group_vars file.

### <a name="vaddress"></a>VADDR_PLAYBOOK

There is one Ansible Play in this playbook.  It configures the virtual address of each Big-IP
device that it's invoked upon.  Several fields are common between both Plays and reference the
group_vars file.
```
# vAddress Playbook
---
- name: Virtual Address Playbook
  hosts: bigip
  connection: local
  tasks:
  - name: Modify Virtual Address
    bigip_virtual_address:
      use_route_advertisement: "{{ vAddrAvailability }}"
      address: "{{ vAddress }}"

__use_route_advertisement:__ "{{ vAddrAvailability }}"
This is set to 'yes' initially.


## <a name="command"></a>COMMAND_PLAYBOOK

There is one Ansible Play in this playbook.  This one issues an arbitrary command to the Big-IP
to modify the local traffic manager's IP-Protocol to be 'any'.
```
# BigIP Command Playbook
---
- name: Bigip Command Playbook
  hosts: bigip
  connection: local
  tasks:
  - name: Modify the ltm
    bigip_command:
      commands: modify ltm virtual "{{ vAddressName }}"
        ip-protocol any profiles replace-all-with { ipother }
      server: "{{ ansible_host }}"
      password: "{{ password }}"
      user: "{{ user }}"
      validate_certs: "{{ validate_certs }}"
```
#### Command Playbook Field:
__[bigip_command](http://f5-ansible.readthedocs.io/en/devel/modules/bigip_command_module.html)__:
The name of the F5 module.

__commands:__
`modify ltm virtual "{{ vAddressName }}" ip-protocol any profiles replace-all-with { ipother }`
This field defines the command that will be invoked.  To have an ip-protocol set to `any`, a specific protocol needs to be set.  That profile is `{ ipother }`.

It is possible that Ansible will issue a warning that this Play is not __Idempotent__.
